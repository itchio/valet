butler.def: manual

For DLL, buildmode=c-shared, set output name

generating butler.lib: from MSVC build tools:

```shell
lib /def:butler.def /out:butler.lib /machine:x64
```

ACTUALLY the `.def` can be autogenerated:

```shell
go build -v -x -buildmode=c-shared -o=butler.dll -ldflags "-extldflags -Wl,--output-def,$(cygpath -w ${PWD}/butler.def)" .
```

Just need to remove a few lines that have too-complicated symbols:

```shell
cat butler.def | grep -v -E '[;{]' >! butler2.def && wc -l butler2.def
```
